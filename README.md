# Curb — Home Assistant Integration

Receive live energy data directly from orphaned **Curb Energy Monitor** hubs
and surface it as native Home Assistant sensors — no MQTT, no polling.

Curb Inc. shut down its cloud in February 2026, orphaning every hub in the
field. After restoring root access (see
[curbed](https://github.com/codearranger/curbed)) and pointing the hub's
on-device `/data/hub-config.json` at your Home Assistant host, the hub
happily POSTs its samples to whatever answers there. This integration is
what answers.

## What it does

- Binds an HTTP listener on a user-configurable host/port.
- Accepts `POST /v3/samples/<serial>` from any number of Curb hubs.
- Decodes the `deflate` + MessagePack body.
- Creates 36 native `sensor.*` entities per hub (or 54 if every
  circuit is marked bi-directional) — two or three per circuit:
  - **Power** (`device_class: power`, `state_class: measurement`, unit `W`)
    — instantaneous draw, derived as `|w| × 3600`.
  - **Energy** (`device_class: energy`, `state_class: total_increasing`,
    unit `kWh`) — cumulative consumption. For non-bidirectional circuits
    it's `Σ |w|`; for bi-directional circuits it's `Σ max(w, 0)` so the
    counter stays monotonic. Persisted across restarts so long-term
    statistics and the Energy dashboard work out of the box.
  - **Energy Production** (same device/state class, only created for
    bi-directional circuits) — cumulative `Σ max(-w, 0)`, i.e. back-feed.
- Each hub appears as its own HA **device** identified by its serial.

`iot_class` is `local_push` — data arrives on every hub sample (~every
few seconds), not polled.

## Installation (HACS)

1. In HACS → Integrations → ⋯ → **Custom repositories**, add
   `https://github.com/pvanbaren/ha-energycurb` with category **Integration**.
2. Install **Curb** and restart Home Assistant.
3. Settings → Devices & services → **Add integration** → **Curb**.
4. Enter the bind host (`0.0.0.0` is fine) and port.

## Pointing your hub at this integration

1. Gain root access to the hub using
   [codearranger/curbed](https://github.com/codearranger/curbed). That
   project walks through unlocking the hub and getting a shell on it.
2. **Back up `/data/hub-config.json` before you touch it** (e.g.
   `cp /data/hub-config.json /data/hub-config.json.orig` and pull a
   copy off the hub). The integration regenerates this file on the
   next config fetch and overwrites the per-channel calibration. The
   backup is the only record of which physical clamp and voltage is
   wired to each of the 18 positions, which you'll need to re-enter
   in the integration's options flow — read each channel's
   `clamp_definition_id` to pick the clamp, and compare its
   `i_multiplier` to the canonical 110 V value for that clamp to
   decide the voltage (a ~2× magnitude means 220 V) and polarity
   (negative means the clamp is inverted).
3. On the hub, edit `/data/hub-config.json` and change every URL under
   the `endpoints` block so the host and port match your Home Assistant
   listener. For a default install that's `http://<ha-host>:8989`:
   ```json
   "endpoints": {
       "hub_config":  "http://<ha-host>:8989/v3/hub_config",
       "messages":    "http://<ha-host>:8989/v3/messages",
       "samples":     "http://<ha-host>:8989/v3/samples",
       "diagnostics": "http://<ha-host>:8989/v3/diagnostics"
   },
   ```
   Replace `<ha-host>` with your HA server's IP or hostname and `8989`
   with the port you picked in the integration setup. Bump the
   `revision` field by one so the streamer re-reads the file on its
   next poll, then restart the hub (or just the `streamer` service).
4. Open the integration's options flow (Settings → Devices & services
   → Curb → Configure). For each of the 18 positions set the clamp
   (100A / 50A / 30A), voltage (110V / 220V), inverted flag, and the
   bi-directional flag using your backup of the original
   `hub-config.json` as reference — match the `clamp_definition_id`
   and the sign/magnitude of the multipliers.

From then on the hub posts samples directly to this integration and
fetches its own future configs from `/v3/hub_config/<serial>` — which
this integration (re)generates on demand from the per-circuit settings
in the options flow, overwriting what you just hand-edited. Your edits
to the `endpoints` block are preserved on each regeneration because the
integration echoes back whatever host:port the hub used to reach it.

### Keeping the hub's original hub-config.json

If you'd rather keep the factory per-channel calibration on the hub
untouched and not have the integration regenerate anything, point the
`hub_config` endpoint at an address that will never respond — e.g. a
blackhole route or a reserved loopback like `http://127.0.0.1:1`:

```json
"endpoints": {
    "hub_config":  "http://127.0.0.1:1/v3/hub_config",
    "messages":    "http://<ha-host>:8989/v3/messages",
    "samples":     "http://<ha-host>:8989/v3/samples",
    "diagnostics": "http://<ha-host>:8989/v3/diagnostics"
},
```

The streamer's every-5-minute config poll will fail silently and the
hub keeps using whatever is already in `/data/hub-config.json`. Samples,
messages and diagnostics still flow to this integration, so the 18
sensor entities work normally — you just won't be able to change the
clamp/voltage mapping from the HA options flow.

## How devices appear

On the first POST from a serial, the integration:

1. Registers an HA device `Curb <serial>` (manufacturer: Curb).
2. Attaches 36 sensors — one power + one energy per circuit, plus one
   extra "Energy Production" sensor for any circuit flagged
   bi-directional. With default circuit names `A1`…`C6`, entity IDs
   come out as:
   ```
   sensor.curb_<serial>_a1              sensor.curb_<serial>_a1_energy
   sensor.curb_<serial>_a2              sensor.curb_<serial>_a2_energy
   …                                     …
   sensor.curb_<serial>_c6              sensor.curb_<serial>_c6_energy
   ```
   And for each bi-directional circuit (e.g. the mains backfed by
   solar):
   ```
   sensor.curb_<serial>_a1_energy_production
   ```
   `unique_id`s are `curb_<serial>_circuit_N` for power sensors,
   `curb_<serial>_circuit_N_energy` for consumption energy, and
   `curb_<serial>_circuit_N_energy_production` for production energy
   (all 1-indexed). Renames and dashboard placements survive reloads
   and restarts even if you change the circuit's friendly name in
   Configure.

After a reload the power sensors show `unavailable` until the hub's
next POST; the energy sensors come back immediately with their last
persisted total. Long-term statistics are preserved through restarts
and reloads.

## Circuit configuration

Each hub exposes 18 circuits in a fixed physical order (groups of 6, 6, 3, 3).
From **Settings → Devices & services → Curb → Configure**, a single form
holds one section per circuit (A1 … C6):

- **Name** — shown as the sensor's friendly name in HA. Defaults run
  A1–A6, B1–B6, C1–C6.
- **Current clamp** — `100A`, `50A`, or `30A` (Xiamen CT).
- **Voltage** — `110V` or `220V`. Each voltage has its own production
  multiplier lookup; 220 V entries are copied verbatim from Curb's
  reference hub-config.json so the generated file matches byte-for-byte.
- **Inverted** — leave unchecked for a correctly-oriented clamp; check
  it to flip the sign of the channel's `i/w/var` multipliers.
- **Bi-directional** — check for circuits that can both import and
  export (e.g. a solar-backfed main). When set, the circuit gets a
  second "Energy Production" sensor and the "Energy" sensor only
  accumulates the positive side.

These values are compiled into a v3.1 `hub-config.json` and served at
`GET /v3/hub_config/<serial>`. The hub picks up changes on its next
5-second message poll (the integration queues a `{"type":"config"}`
hub message whenever you save, so there's no 5-minute wait for the
periodic refresh).

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing shows up**: confirm the hub's `/data/hub-config.json` has
  your HA host:port in every `endpoints.*` URL, and check the hub's
  `/var/log/streamer.log` for POST responses. Check HA logs for
  `Curb listening on …`.
- **`Failed to bind … Address already in use`**: another service has the
  port. Pick a different one and reconfigure.
- **Entities stay unavailable**: the hub has reached you but its samples
  don't contain the expected 18 circuits. Enable debug logging:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    logs:
      custom_components.energycurb: debug
  ```
- **Check the hub's own logs** in `/var/log/` on the device.
  `streamer.log` is the most useful when samples aren't reaching HA —
  it records the actual POSTs and their HTTP status codes.
  `sampler.log` shows ADE reads and per-sample errors on the way into
  the batch; `messages.log` covers the `/v3/messages` polling.
